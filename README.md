test_1.py uses a method called binary tuning, which is similar binary search and the Newton-Raphson method.
What it does is find the best result between two numbers, then split the range in half based on which number got the best result.
## It is best to put the number of tests as a multiple of 3. For example, if you want 10 tests, use 30 as the test limit.
